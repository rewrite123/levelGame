		<h3>Welcome To Dungeon Tales</h3>
		<p>
		Dungeon Tales is a simple game wherein you play the role of a knight who is trying desperately to leave a dungeon he got lost in. 
		The controls are simple (WASD), as is the game. You beat enemies by running into them. 
		If you are a higher level than they are, they die, and you gain their level. That's it for now. Have fun!
